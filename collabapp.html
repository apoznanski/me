      <h4>Challenge</h4>
      <p>People frequently collect, share, organize, and evaluate information in pursuit of a common goal with
        others‚Äîyet there are few web tools which provide end-to-end support in this process. Existing stand-alone
        systems are unwieldy and move the user away from familiar tools and workflows.
        <br><br>
        Tools such as Google Docs and Sheets help users collect information, but they don't support the creation of
        useful organizational structures, making options more difficult to compare. In this project we aimed to uncover
        how current systems fail in order to design a better system for collaborative search.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pb-5">
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>We based our hypotheses on findings from current literature on collaborative search and sense-making. The
        barriers to collaborative research fall into three broad categories: awareness problems (1), communication
        problems (2), and sense-making problems (3).<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Awareness is a problem when users don't have adequate knowledge of the search process, results, and
          constraints of others. This can lead to redundant work and irrelevant results.</li>
        <li>Communication and collaboration problems generally manifest in the feedback process. Poor systematic support
          for feedback is a particularly acute pain point because it can slow and stop the decision-making process.</li>
        <li>Sense-making problems occur when the system doesn't permit the creation or sharing of informative
          representations of data. For example, map data, review data, and visual data are poorly integrated in many
          systems.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      We interviewed 20 people who had used tools such as text messaging, Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Notion to
      complete a collaborative search task in order to explore the shortcomings of current systems. After analyzing our
      interview data using open coding and thematic analysis, we observed three main findings:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Current systems lack lightweight (easy to use and understand) features for collection and organization.</li>
        <li>Eliciting timely feedback can be difficult due to arduous feedback formats and information sharing methods.
        </li>
        <li>The perceived cost of setting up structured systems prevents users from gaining value in the search process.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="pb-5">
      <h4>Design goals</h4>
      <p>Based on the above findings, we established the following design goals for our interface:<br><br>
        <span class="dg">Deciding factors</span> üóí<br>
        Provide a lightweight method for note taking and tagging, and clipping functionality to distinguish the features
        of each source.<br><br>
        <span class="dg">Feedback</span> üí¨<br>
        Enable quick feedback on sources and shortlisting capability to aid the decision making process.<br><br>
        <span class="dg">Structure</span> üìÅ<br>
        Organize collected information into a meaningful structured system at no cost, providing immediate benefits to
        users.<br><br>
        <span class="dg">Awareness</span> üîé<br>Increase awareness by identifying the task assignments, search
        constraints, and individual contributions to avoid redundancy in the research process.

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>Our interview findings can be used as part of a basis for the design of future collaborative search systems.
        Because of the time-consuming and information-rich nature of these kinds of tasks, we recommend that future
        systems incorporate automated elements such as automatic reminders to supply feedback and recommendations for
        sharing web page elements. I thoroughly enjoyed the research and design aspects of this project, which forced me
        to face the stubborn issues of collaboration and decision-making with an open mind. This project sparked my
        interest in social computing, which I hope to explore further in my future work.</p>
